# EcoSign Public Documentation

This folder is the only public-safe documentation surface tracked by default.

Scope:
- product guarantees,
- public verifier behavior,
- non-enabling protocol commitments.

Out of scope:
- implementation recipes,
- internal scoring/heuristics,
- architecture details that enable protocol reconstruction.

If a document exposes implementation-enabling details, it must remain outside tracked public docs.
